**CFWSetup**

What is it?
* A super-simple open-source python app to set up your SD card for pirating switch games in just a few clicks.
* Uses only standard libraries (except PyUSB which is downloaded at user's request)

With CFWSetup, all files are pulled directly from github (if the dev effectively uses releases) or from an always-up-to-date direct link if provided by the developer. I have removed some software included with previous versions due to a lack of a stable location to download from.

Notice: If no software is shown in the menu when you launch the app it means you either have no internet connection or the github api has received too many requests. Wait a bit and try again later, I have plans to fix this in a later version. Currently the app will fall back on a previously downloaded json from the api if getting a new one fails.


How do I use it?
* To start on windows: double-click the bat file after installing 
[python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)
    * YOU WILL HAVE TO RESTART YOUR PC AFTERWARD FOR PYTHON'S PATH TO UPDATE
* Launch via the standard method on mac / linux
